# pytorch-ddpm

Goal of this educational repository is to provide a self-contained, minimalistic implementation of diffusion models using Pytorch.

base implementation taken from: https://github.com/cloneofsimo/minDiffusion

In order to generate diffusion model for mnist, simply run
```
$ python superminddpm.py
```

sample outputs are available [here](./Oct-00-29-21)
